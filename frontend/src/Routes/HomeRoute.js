import React from "react";

export default function HomeRoute() {
  return (
    <div>
      Home page and about page Implementation left. Check note route but be sure
      to login or signup before going to note route. Also due to limited time
      span, i wasn't able to apply validations and other features meanwhile CRUD
      operation to create, update, delete and reading note can be done.
    </div>
  );
}
